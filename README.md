# Saffron-Grading-System
Automated Saffron Quality Classification System.
A Fusion of Prolog and Python for Quality Assessment.

# Problem Statement
Challenges in manually classifying saffron based on color and shape.
Need for an automated system to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

# Objective
Develop an expert system using Prolog for saffron quality classification.
Classify saffron into High quality (Grade 1), Medium quality (Grade 2), Low quality (Grade 3) based on color , size , thickness and shape.

# Project Components
Prolog Component:
  Responsible for classification rules.
  Utilizes logical reasoning for grading.
Python Component:
  Handles image processing.
  Analyzes color, length, thickness, and shape.

# Implementation Details
Prolog Code:
  Defines grading rules.
  Calls Python script.
Python Code:
  Analyzes color, length, thickness, and shape.
  Outputs results for Prolog.

# Future Enhancements
Machine Learning: Enhance accuracy using machine learning models.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for farmers.
Integration: Connect with databases for tracking saffron quality over time.

# Saffron Characteristics
